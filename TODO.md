# TODO list

- [x] Migrate package.xml and CMakeLists.txt from the old repo
- [x] Modify the files
- [x] Installation instructions in README.md

  seems like the rotorS packages are available as Debian packages.

  `sudo apt install ros-melodic-rotors-*`

  maybe, I can just add `rotors-simulator` in package.xml? => no it didn't..

- [ ] Make a script to download and setup a world model in .gazebo
- [ ] Make and test a launch file
- [ ] Rename the package "mav_tunnel_nav"
- [ ] Rename the github repo as well
- [ ] Update the installation+setup instructions
- [ ] Add a manual control(?)
